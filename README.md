# TaskFlow: An Intelligent To-Do List Web App

TaskFlow is a modern, full-stack to-do list application designed to help you stay organized and productive. It features a clean, responsive user interface and is powered by AI to help you prioritize your tasks effectively.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is a To-Do List web application that supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. It's built with a modern tech stack centered around typical MERN principles, Next.js and leverages Google's Generative AI for intelligent task prioritization.

### ‚ú® Key Features

- **Add, Edit, and Delete Tasks:** Full CRUD operations to manage your to-do list.
- **Mark as Complete:** Easily track your progress by marking tasks as done.
- **Persistent Storage:** Your tasks are saved in your browser's local storage, so you won't lose them.
- **Responsive UI/UX:** A clean, intuitive, and mobile-friendly interface built with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI.
- **AI-Powered Prioritization:** A unique feature that uses AI to analyze your tasks and suggest priorities, helping you focus on what matters most.
